# Intro-To-Computing-ECE120-FA19
This repository contains all my coursework projects for Intro to Computing (ECE 120), taken at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign during the Fall 2019 semester. Some of the important concepts I learned were an introduction to C programming, network analysis and design, and the LC3 machine language.
