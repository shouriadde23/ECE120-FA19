# Intro-To-Computing-ECE120-FA19
This repository contains all my coursework projects for Intro to Computing (ECE 120), taken at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign during the Fall 2019 semester. Some of the important concepts I learned were an introduction to C programming, network analysis and design, and the LC3 Assembly language programming. 

**• LC3_Word_Print_lab13** - Used LC3 programming to code a word or phrase with the special character keyboard pattern provided by the user.

**• LC3_Char_Print_lab12** - Used LC3 programming to code a singlular letter or symbol with the special keyboard character provided by the user.

**• LC_3_Factorial_lab11** - Used LC3 programming to compute the factorial of a user provided number.

**• Binary_PosNums_Sum_lab10** - Program written in binary which determines the first 10 positive numbers and sums them together.

**• Binary_Intro_lab9** - Program written in binary which adds a value of 36 to an already existing number.

**• C_Intro_lab2** - Simple C program which prints the first 16 perfect squares.

**• Basic_Intro_lab1** - Simple assignment which taught how to read files and place them in appropriate directories.
