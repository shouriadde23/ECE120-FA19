QUESTION 1.  Read through the program lab9.bin. What do you expect the program to do? More specifically, which register will the program modify when it is run, and what will it contain when the program finishes? (You can probably figure this out merely by reading the comments provided in lab9.bin.)

ANSWER: The register that the program will modify is register R2 and it will contain the decimal number value of 12.

QUESTION 2.  Explain in a few sentences why the ability to step through a program (run one instruction at a time) is a very useful tool for debugging a program. Debugging is the process of finding and correcting bugs (or errors) in a program. Hint: Finding a bug is often much more difficult than correcting it.

ANSWER: The ability to step through a program is a useful tool for debugging because it allows the programmer to see the overall changes in the code execution by looking through the lines of code one line at a time. This helps the programmer pinpoint exactly where the program execution is incorrect based on which line/lines of code don't work properly and result in errors.
